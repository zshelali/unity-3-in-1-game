The actual game's files could not be uploaded directly here as we didn't work on github at all. I will probably take some time to upload each file one day, but currently it's just easier to download it directly off of Dropbox. 
I just put them on GitHub so I could organize all of my projects in one place.

## Ali Hajeri - Pierre Guerout - Louis Thomas

**Contains :** 

* The 3 in 1 assets package with the 3 games, all are finished except mini UFO that is still in beta.

* A video in *2 in order to have a quick overview on all the functionalities and in case the game doesn't work after importing it.

* A .zip file with all the project and assets (because I tried to reimport the asset package in a new project and the game didn't work properly, but it did with the .zip)




The 3 and 1 project is called "Brick Breaker" (couldn't rename it) but it contains all the games.

Added features for Apple catcher :
Its new features : time counter, better border support, end game (bugs)
Controls :

* left and right arrows to move

* R to reposition the ball, lose 1 life and 500 points (in case the ball gets stuck in a really long and annoying movement)

Mini UFO is unfinished, we have included it anyway.

Controls : 
* esc to exit at any time
* 4 arrows to move around

To prove that it works we have a video of the game (just in case).
